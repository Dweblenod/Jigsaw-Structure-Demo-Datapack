# Jigsaw-Structure-Demo-Datapack

This is an example datapack containing everything you need to generate basic jigsaw block structures in your Minecraft world.
I would not advise assuming this is the only way to get it to work or even the most effecient way to get things to work, however I do believe the approach is very simple which can help with picking it up.

A very useful online tool is the [Data Pack Generator site](https://misode.github.io/). I have included several short Shortcut links to parts of that website showing how you can get the same result that appears in this pack.

Another useful guide is [this one by GentlemanRevvnar](https://gist.github.com/GentlemanRevvnar/98a8f191f46d28f63592672022c41497). Some minor aspects of it may be outdated as individual files associated with structure generation have changed format overtime.
