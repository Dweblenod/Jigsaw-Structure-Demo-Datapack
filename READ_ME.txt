This is an example datapack containing everything you need to generate basic jigsaw block structures in your world.
I would not advise assuming this is the only way to get it to work or even the most effecient way to get things to work, however I do believe the approach is very simple which can help with picking it up.

A very useful online tool is the Data Pack Generator site (https://misode.github.io/). I have included several short Shortcut links to parts of that website showing how you can get the same result that appears in this pack.
